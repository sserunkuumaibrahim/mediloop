# Mediloop: Uganda's Digital Health Revolution

## Introduction

**Narrator Script:**
"Imagine a world where every Ugandan has instant access to quality healthcare, no matter where they are. Where your health data is truly yours, and AI-powered diagnostics are available through the app you use every day. This isn't science fiction—it's Mediloop, Uganda's national digital health infrastructure."

## The Problem: Healthcare in Uganda Today

**Visuals:** Show statistics, current healthcare challenges, rural vs urban divide

**Narrator Script:**
"Uganda faces significant healthcare challenges:
- Over 70% of the population lives in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities
- Long waiting times and travel distances prevent timely medical care
- Fragmented health records make continuity of care difficult
- Limited access to specialist consultations
- Healthcare costs burden families and the economy

These challenges create a healthcare gap that affects millions of Ugandans every day."

## The Solution: Mediloop's Vision

**Narrator Script:**
"Mediloop is launching first in Uganda to bridge this gap. We're building the nation's digital health infrastructure with three core pillars:

1. **Universal Health ID (UHID)** - Every Ugandan gets a secure, digital health identity
2. **Connected Provider Network** - 1000+ healthcare facilities working together seamlessly
3. **AI-Powered Digital Services** - Instant diagnostics and care through accessible platforms"

## Key Features & Innovation

### WhatsApp AI Diagnostics

No downloads required. Works on any phone, anywhere in Uganda."

## 8-Second Promo (Social) — Storyboard & Script

Purpose: A sharp, high-impact 8-second social promo that clearly communicates Mediloop's core value — instant, accessible healthcare for every Ugandan via UHID + WhatsApp — and drives viewers to visit the website.

Format: Two versions recommended — vertical (9:16) for Reels/Shorts, horizontal (16:9) for web/ads. Deliver both at 1080p.

Timing (0:00–0:08):

- 0.00–0.50s — Scene 1 — Logo & Hook
	- Visual: Quick full-screen Mediloop logo pop with soft teal glow + subtle lens flare. Background: blurred hero photo (doctor + patient) dimmed.
	- On-screen text (bold): "Mediloop" (logo only) — then quick subtitle: "Health for Every Ugandan"
	- VO (fast, confident): "Mediloop."
	- Music/SFX: single uplifting hit, low rumble.

- 0.50–2.00s — Scene 2 — WhatsApp Access
	- Visual: Fast screen-record animation of a WhatsApp chat where a user types a symptom and the bot replies with an AI assessment. Show a small UHID icon next to the user name.
	- On-screen text: "WhatsApp AI diagnostics — no app needed"
	- VO (clear): "Instant diagnostics on WhatsApp."
	- Motion: Quick zoom-in on chat bubble, pulse on reply.

- 2.00–4.50s — Scene 3 — UHID & Provider Network
	- Visual: Split-second montage: UHID card animation flipping → map of Uganda with connecting lines to clinics/hospitals → a clinician viewing a patient's record on a tablet.
	- On-screen text: "Secure UHID • 1000+ providers"
	- VO (warm): "Your UHID connects you to care nationwide."
	- Graphics: Animated network lines, teal nodes, subtle map glow.

- 4.50–6.50s — Scene 4 — Real Impact (Emotion)
	- Visual: Rapid b-roll: mother with child smiling at clinic, nurse tapping tablet, ambulance arriving. Use close-ups for empathy.
	- On-screen text: "Better outcomes. Lower costs."
	- VO (uplifting): "Faster care. Better outcomes."
	- Music: Crescendo picks up, rhythmic heartbeat subtly mixed in.

- 6.50–8.00s — Scene 5 — CTA & Tagline
	- Visual: Strong end-frame with Mediloop logo centered, website `mediloop.co` and WhatsApp CTA (#number or short instruction), UHID badge subtle at corner.
	- On-screen text (large): "Mediloop — Healthcare for Every Ugandan"
	- VO (firm): "Mediloop. Health for every Ugandan."
	- SFX: Uplifting final chord, quick whoosh.

Production Specs & Notes:
- Duration: 8 seconds (total)
- Deliverables: Vertical (9:16) 1080x1920, Horizontal (16:9) 1920x1080, MP4 H.264, 30fps. Include srt caption file.
- Voiceover: 1-line per scene; tone: warm, confident, Ugandan-accent preferred. VO should be short and punchy to match the rapid cuts.
- On-screen text: Keep to 3–6 words per frame; use Mediloop teal (#0d9488 / Tailwind `teal-600`) for highlights and white/near-black text for contrast depending on background.
- Subtitles & Accessibility: Include captions (SRT) and ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA. Add audio-descriptive still frame if required.
- Music: Uplifting African instrumental with modern electronic elements; tempo ~100–110 BPM; must be cleared for social use.
- Graphics: Use Mediloop logo and UHID badge assets from `public/assets/mediloop.png` and `mediloop-ico.png`. Animated network lines in teal/white.
- Localization: Produce three subtitle or VO track options — English, Luganda, Swahili — for targeted runs.
- Legal/Compliance: Avoid medical claims; use phrasing like "AI-powered assessments" and "guidance" rather than definitive diagnoses.

Edit Notes for the Editor:
- Keep cuts very tight with smooth transitions (fast cross-dissolve, quick whip-pan for map to clinic footage).
- Ensure WhatsApp UI is shown generically, avoid showing third-party trademarks close-up if permissions are required — use a stylized chat UI if needed.
- Prioritize readability for small screens: large CTAs and bold typography on final frame.

Example On-Screen Text (per frame):
- 0.00 — "Mediloop"
- 0.50 — "WhatsApp AI diagnostics"
- 2.00 — "Secure UHID • 1000+ providers"
- 4.50 — "Faster care. Better outcomes."
- 6.50 — "Mediloop — mediloop.co"

Timing & Frame Counts (30fps reference):
- 0–15 (0.00–0.50s): Logo reveal
- 15–60 (0.50–2.00s): WhatsApp demo
- 60–135 (2.00–4.50s): UHID & map montage
- 135–195 (4.50–6.50s): Impact b-roll
- 195–240 (6.50–8.00s): Final CTA

Final delivery checklist:
- Vertical & horizontal MP4s
- SRT captions (English, Luganda, Swahili)

- Stills: logo, UHID badge, hero background
- License info for music
